# GroupmeBot
This project is inteded to learn how to use REST api's and to organize code from the top down. 
Feel free to take the source code and use it yourself. 
If you want to do that you'll have to set up your own API key and grab the group id. 
For more information see the groupme dev site. https://dev.groupme.com 
Once you have that either hard code them into your own version, set them as source variables (as I have in repository)
or create a seperate file that contains the values.
